# Superstore Sales Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

This project explores Superstore sales data with the goal of identifying actionable insights for business decision-making. I cleaned and analyzed the raw sales dataset (Excel format), visualized trends, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard for reporting.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and organize raw Superstore data (Excel)
- Identify key patterns in sales, profit, product performance, and customer behavior
- Visualize monthly and category-wise trends
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters and slicers
- Provide clear, business-friendly insights and recommendations

---

## Data Cleaning

- Removed missing and duplicate records
- Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to datetime
- Extracted useful features like **Month**, **Year**, and **Region**
- Verified data types and column formats for Power BI compatibility

---

## Exploratory Analysis

- **Best-Selling Products**: Based on total profit
- **Most-Selling Products**: Based on quantity sold
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Identified seasonal spikes
- **Category & Sub-Category Performance**: Tracked sales and profits
- **Regional Analysis**: Compared performance across regions
- **Customer Segments**: Analyzed profitability by segment

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The final dashboard includes:

- Filters (slicers) for **Year**, **Region**, **Category**, and **Segment**
- **Monthly Sales Trend** line chart
- **Top 10 Products by Sales & Profit**
- **Sales by Region** map
- **Category Performance** bar charts
- **Customer Segments** pie chart

---

## Business Insights

- **Staples** and **Technology** generate high volume but differ in profitability
- **West and East** regions dominate sales, but **South** underperforms
- **Home Office** segment shows strong profit margins—good for upselling
- Not all high-selling products are highly profitable → focus on optimizing both

---

## Recommendations

- Promote **high-profit items** over just high-quantity items
- Investigate **low-performing regions** and adjust marketing/supply strategy
- Prepare for **monthly sales peaks** with inventory and logistics planning
- Target **profitable customer segments** (e.g., Home Office) for retention

---

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (raw data source)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for preliminary analysis
- Power BI for interactive visualization and dashboard building

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add time-series forecasting for sales
- Include shipping cost analysis for logistics planning
- Automate data refresh in Power BI with connected Excel or SQL source
